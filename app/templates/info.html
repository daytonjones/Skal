            <p class="mt-2">
                Mead, also known as honey wine, is considered one of the oldest fermented drinks in human history, dating back thousands of years. Ancient cultures such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Vikings were known to brew mead, often viewing it as a gift from the gods. In many mythologies, mead was believed to bestow wisdom and immortality. It was an important part of celebrations and rituals, particularly in European cultures, before declining in popularity with the rise of beer and wine.

            <p class="mt-2">
                Beer is one of the world's oldest prepared beverages, with evidence of brewing dating back over 7,000 years to ancient Mesopotamia. The Sumerians had a goddess of beer, Ninkasi, and even wrote hymns detailing the brewing process. Over time, beer became a staple in many cultures, with monks in medieval Europe refining brewing techniques. With the advent of modern industrialization, beer production expanded globally, leading to a variety of styles and brewing traditions that continue to evolve today.
